This project is an **exploration-driven research study** on improving the **Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB)** model for sentiment classification. Using the [IMDb movie review dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews/data), we investigate **three distinct methods** to enhance the modelâ€™s performance â€” focusing on accuracy, feature quality, and computational efficiency â€” while preserving the modelâ€™s simplicity and interpretability.

## Research Objective

While MNB is widely used for text classification due to its simplicity and interpretability, it has known limitations. This project explores three complementary methods to improve MNB:

1. **Hyperparameter Tuning**  
   Fine-tuning model parameters (e.g., smoothing factor `alpha`, n-gram range) to increase predictive accuracy.

2. **Enhancement Techniques**  
   Improving feature representation by:
   - Replacing `CountVectorizer` with `TfidfVectorizer`
   - Boosting the importance of discriminative keywords identified from the model

3. **Efficiency Optimization** *(Planned)*  
   Applying methods such as dimensionality reduction and sparse matrix optimization to reduce runtime and memory usage without sacrificing performance.
